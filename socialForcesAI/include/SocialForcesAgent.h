Hi Qi,

Have you worked on A3? And if so, can you send me what you've done so far. I haven't really been able to work on it because I've been pretty sick the past few days. Also, if you went to lecture today, did they mention anything about the assignment deadlines?

Sorry I didn't do it, my other project has begun... I remember the professor saying to someone that it should be Friday, but it hasn't changed yet so I'm no sure.

Sorry about not doing much for this assignment, I had to catch up on my job and other project since last Thursday. I just returned from class and had dinner, and will see what I can do. If you have any part done, or just partial code, please share them

I'm just starting out. I may write the maze solver first if you want to write something else. A small tip in case you haven't figured it out: the behaviors like pursue are defined in xml, and the format is like this:(insert the behavior in a child goal of the goal sequence of an agent or agentregion; the behaviour must have steeringaAlgorithm and Parameters)



<goalSequence>
<seekStaticTarget>
<targetLocation> <x>-90</x> <y>0</y> <z>30</z> </targetLocation>
<desiredSpeed>1.3</desiredSpeed>
<timeDuration>1000.0</timeDuration>
<Behaviour>
<SteeringAlgorithm>WallFollower</SteeringAlgorithm>
<Parameters>
<Parameter><key>test11</key>
<value>1</value></Parameter>
</Parameters>
</Behaviour>
</seekStaticTarget>
</goalSequence>

And we can get the behaviours with Behaviour::getSteeringAlg() (just a string) and  std::vector<BehaviourParameter> Behaviour::getParameters(), and a BehaviourParameter has public fields key and value, both are strings,


QI DONG

to me, Zachary
and to get the behaviour in UpdateAI where we need it, use the current goal; like this

SteerLib::AgentGoalInfo goalInfo = _goalQueue.front();
//todo:debug - there are many agents and most don't have a behavior, so only print those that have
if(test && (goalInfo.targetBehaviour.getSteeringAlg()!=""))
{
    test=false;
    std::cerr << goalInfo.targetBehaviour.getSteeringAlg() << ", " <<std::endl;
    int q;
    for (q=0; q < goalInfo.targetBehaviour.getParameters().size(); q++ )
    {
        std::cerr << " Parameter" << std::endl;
        std::cerr << "\tkey: " << goalInfo.targetBehaviour.getParameters().at(q).key
        << " value " << goalInfo.targetBehaviour.getParameters().at(q).value << std::endl;
    }
    }

    The changes made are only in the calcWallRepulsionForce method, right?

    I'm modifying that and it should be the only modification that matters. But I might have changed stuff to debug. You can remove other modifications.

    I think my wall follower is OK. Sometimes an agent gets squeezed into a wall if the wall-following force is large, but too small a force will cause it to freeze so I left it like that. The balance between attraction to a wall and following along a wall is tricky, using the default of 100, 100 is fine for that test case. What else do you want me work on?
    
Note: my new behavior code is put between comments like //begin behaviour wallfollower and //end behavior, to be more readable.

    I'm working on leader following (group behavior),  so I guess you can work on another one of the individual behaviors.

    to me, Zachary
    OK, but do you know what exactly do the behaviors mean besides wall follower(it sounds clear so I did it first)? What is expected in pursue and evade - does the behaviour do both at the same time? And how to specify an agent as a moving target? And I don't know what is growing spiral or Unaligned Collision Avoidance.
    
    By the way, Zachary, you don't have to do the C++ homework(though it's a good idea to at least read and run our code) if you would rather work on Unity. We need more hands in Unity, especially for B3. Behavior Trees are tricky! Please start looking into it and at least get going and solve the basic problems before we move on to that.

    Some agents pursue and others evade at the same time I'm pretty sure. Can't you just set some parameter in the xml that indicates whether it is a target, and give its parameters to a pursue agent? I think growing spiral is when an agent or agents start in the center and then spiral outward.
    
http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/ has more info on pursue and evade, and on unaligned collision avoidance.

    I just got out of an exam. Now that it's over and I don't have to preoccupy myself with studying, I can start on unity.

    I wonder how you can let another agent know the identity or role of another agent? I saw no good way of doing that if we can only change the social agent files, as AgentInterface doesn't support any given name of the agent. There's an ID, sure, and you might take advantage of that as a module automatically gives ascending ids, so you can make everyone follow the #1 leader, but in pursue there's no straightforward solution.

    What if you make all the agents with an odd id, x, pursue an agent with an even id, x + 1?

    Do you want to meet up today? I need some help understanding the code, I know pretty much everything I need to do for the behavior to work, but I'm not entirely sure how to put it into code.

    Hi are you home yet?
    Please send the package for the B2 assignment you worked on to all of us, so we can use some code later. And remember to follow up on the other group member. I expect to be busy next week so may not help you too much on B3.
